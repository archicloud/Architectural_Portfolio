# Architectural_Portfolio
This project is a two-fold outcome. It is intended to showcase my graduate and post-graduate Architectural works necessary to highlight my skills and development in my current trade of practice. Secondly, I intend to use this as a practice ground to develop and improve my coding abilities. I also intend to use this as reference to my prospective employers in the near future when I break into the world of tech. 

The content of my Architectural works in summary involves the following categories:
    a. Undergraduate works 
        -This shall cover mostly creative works whose inception was formed during my stay in the university
    b. Post-graduate works
        -This shall cover mostly works that I've covered during my stay in my employers, works where I was able to participate and works I had direct involvement with during my stay in my previous workplace.
